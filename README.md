TOPIC: PROTEINS AS DRUG TARGETS IN CANCER DRUG DISCOVERY

Proteins are important drug targets due to their vital involvement in virtually all biological processes, including those related to disease development and progression. They act as the primary effectors of cellular functions, and their dysfunction is often implicated in diseases, making them ideal targets for therapeutic intervention. As enzymes, receptors, ion channels, or structural components, proteins interact with small molecules or other macromolecules to regulate various cellular activities. By targeting specific proteins with drugs, it is possible to modulate their activity, thereby influencing the disease process. For instance, in the case of enzyme inhibition, a drug can bind to an enzyme's active site, reducing its activity and mitigating the disease's effects (Patel et al., 2021).

Cancer is characterized by uncontrolled cell growth and proliferation, often driven by the dysregulation of signaling pathways involving specific proteins. Targeting these proteins can help restore normal cellular functions or selectively kill cancer cells. For example, the protein kinase B-Raf (BRAF) is a key player in the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, which is involved in cell division and differentiation. Mutations in the BRAF gene, particularly the V600E mutation, are commonly found in melanoma and other cancers. Drugs like vemurafenib and dabrafenib specifically target the mutant BRAF protein, inhibiting its activity and thereby slowing the progression of cancer (Chapman et al., 2011; Robert et al., 2015).

Also, the targeting of tyrosine kinase receptors in cancer therapy. Tyrosine kinases are enzymes that play a crucial role in the signaling pathways controlling cell proliferation and survival. The overexpression or mutation of tyrosine kinases, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), has been linked to various cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). EGFR inhibitors, such as gefitinib and erlotinib, have been developed to block the aberrant signaling caused by these mutations, leading to tumor shrinkage and prolonged patient survival (Mok et al., 2009).

Furthermore, monoclonal antibodies are designed to recognize and bind to specific proteins on the surface of cancer cells. For example, trastuzumab targets the HER2 protein, which is overexpressed in some breast cancers. By binding to HER2, trastuzumab inhibits cell growth and mediates immune responses that kill the cancer cells (Slamon et al., 2001).

The application of protein-targeted therapies has enormously revolutionized cancer treatment, offering more precise and personalized approaches to combat the disease. The ongoing research in this field continues to uncover new protein targets and develop innovative drugs, highlighting the importance of proteins in the drug discovery process. These advances not only improve the efficacy of cancer treatments but also reduce the side effects associated with traditional chemotherapy, underscoring the critical role of proteins in modern therapeutic approaches.
